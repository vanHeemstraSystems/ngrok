**NOTE**: Instead of using a [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet) (as demo-ed in above video), we use NodeJS based applications to fulfill the same purpose. NodeJS and Laravel are both server side technologies, using the two in conjunction doesn't really make much sense without a little understanding of what you're trying to accomplish. If you're interested in real-time communication, take a look at [Pusher](https://pusher.com/) it's a great library and Jeffrey has a tutorial on it. We have a [TP-Link Archer Router](https://www.tp-link.com/nl/home-networking/wifi-router/) in our home for routing our web traffic.
